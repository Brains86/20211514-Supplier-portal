          <h1>Reports and rooming lists </h1>
                   
          <p>The Supplier Portal provides an overview of various reports. Here you will find reservation lists and request (reports), but also rooming lists.</p>
          <p>Depending on the agreements we have made with you, you have access to one of those two.</p>
          
          <p>It is not possible to work with both systems; you either work with reports or rooming lists.</p>
          
          <h2>A.  Reports</h2>

          <p>On the ‘reports’ page, you will find two types of documents: </p>
          <p>-  Reservation lists and <br>
          -  Requests</p>

          <p>The name of the document consists of the date on which it was released. Reservation List 20210122 for example, tells us that this reservation list was made available on the 22 January 2021.</p>

          <p>The other columns will give you more information on the size of the document, the date on which it was made available, and the earliest reservation date within that reservation list or request. The check mark in the last column will show whether the document has been opened by you, or your colleague.</p>

          <p>By clicking on one of these five headers, you can sort the list according to name, size, date, earliest reservation date, or whether the file has been opened or not <i>(note: this is still a work in progress)</i>.
          </p>

          <P>When a new reservation has been made on our website, for which one or more elements need to be requested through you, then a ‘request’ will automatically be sent to you. You will also be notified about this on the ‘ANWB Messages’ page. When you open this PDF file, the first page contains an automated message, which will give you further instructions. </P>

          <p>The second page features the details of the reservation, and contains the following information:</p>

          <p>When you open the reservation through 'Reservations' or 'Individuals' you can use the 'Approve Requests' button to confirm the reservation. It is also possible to confirm or decline the request per element. An automatic message will be sent to us. Please note that once you have confirmed the request, it will first have to be processed manually by us. Until then the reservation will still be visible as a request.</p>

         <p>- A header with the booking number, name of the party, booking date, name of the tour and status of the booking<br>
          - Details of the participants<br>
          - Elements that have been booked<br>
          - Essences and preferences of the participants<br>
          - Extra information, if applicable<br>
          </p>

          <p>When bookings are made on our website, whereby none of the elements need to be requested (because they are already confirmed based on our contract), then a ‘reservation list’ will be sent to you. This reservation list will update you on the new bookings that have been made, as well as any modified or cancelled reservations. It contains the same information as a ‘request’ (as listed above), but may contain several bookings, whereas a ‘request’ only contains one booking. </p>
                  
          <p>A reservation list will be sent twice a day, around 6AM and 3PM, but only if there is new information to submit. When no new bookings have been made, and existing bookings have not been modified or cancelled, then you will not receive any new reservation lists. </p>

          <h2>B.  Roominglists</h2>

          <p>On the page ‘Roominglists’ you will find an overview of all the group tours from which we have released the rooming list. The ‘start date’ is the date on which our guests will depart from the Netherlands (so keep in mind that the arrival on the destination might be one or two days later, depending on transport methods, such as overnight flights or ferries). </p>
          
          <p>The ‘main element’ is the name of the tour. Under ‘bookings’ you can view the number of bookings that have been made for that specific tour. By clicking on one of these three headers, you can sort the list by start date, by main element, or by the number of bookings.</p>

          <p>On a roominglist, you will find all the information about a particular group tour of a specific departure date. Roominglists are commonly made available around one month before departure, but this might vary depending on the agreements we have made with you. Once a roominglist has been made available, you will be notified on the ‘ANWB Messages’ page. If, for any reason, you need a roominglist before it has been made available by us, please contact us and we can send a preliminary roominglist via e-mail if necessary.</p>
          
          <p>A roominglist is an overview of all the reservations that have been made on that specific departure date within the same group. A roominglist contains the following details for every reservation within the group:<br>
          - Details of the participants<br>
          - Elements that have been booked<br>
          - Essences and preferences of the participants<br>
          - Extra information, if applicable<br>
          </p>

          <P>At the top of the page, on the right, you can download the roominglist and export it to Excel. You are also able to print the  roominglists directly. At the bottom of the page, you will see an overview of the total amount of pax that have booked. You will also be able to see the total occupation figure per room type.</P>
          
          <p>Once a roominglist has been made available, the status of the group tour will automatically change to ‘on request’ on our website. All new reservations that might be made afterwards, will be sent to you on request. In that case, we will send a memo within that specific reservation number to which you are able to reply, and confirm whether you are able to accommodate our guest. </p>
